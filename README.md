# linkanpack
A datapack for Minecraft

For this datapack I uses some work of my own, and adapts some command block stuff for datapacks.

There will be some changes to loot_tables, recepis, and some functions. Right now a couple of recepis for red sand, gravel and normal sand are in, and a function to run faster on path blocks, and jump higher when standing on slime blocks.
